i installed ndn from the doc Install.rst

then while compiling the error with boost libraries not found went away

i got new error - checking for boost  inkages - blah..

so i gave the path to boost libraries

1) ./waf configure --boost-+libs=/usr/libs/x86_64-linux-gnu
2) ./waf --boost-libs=/usr/libs/x86_64-linux-gnu
3) ./waf install --boost-libs=/usr/libs/x86_64-linux-gnu

4) ./waf docs --boost-libs=/usr/libs/x86_64-linux-gnu
errors from parser

i followed the steps of installing from ndnSim - getting started
however, ./waf configure --enable-examples in ns-3 threw error - 'unable to find module doxygen'

i checked the wscript file of ns-3...it was getting abspath of a variable.
i dont know where this variable was declared so i could not modify it
i simply hardocded the path


wsciprt of ns-3 folder
line 19
tooldir=['/home/vartika/ndnSIM/ndn-cxx/.waf-tools]

it compiles but gives warning that libcrypto is present (561) but not going to use it
i dont know why

today yeonho asked me to use vmplayer
he installed his instance of VM on my computer

it was 12.04
so i installed one more instance of 14.04

what he did different was the link...the links provided by ndnsim webpage are incorrect
he asked me to use
ndnsim.net/2.1/getting-started.html instead of
ndnsim.net/2.0/getting-started.html

here the visualizer was not enabled. the pybindgen folder didnt have the ndnsim/pybindgen/pybindgen/version.py

so i deleted this folder and downloaded from a different site
git clone https://github.com/cawka/pybindgen.git instead of 
git clone https://github.com/named-data-ndnSIM/pybindgen.git pybindgen 

now the error was with the version...ndnSim/ns-3 wanted version  0.17.0.post45+ng4806e4f whereas i was providing 0.17.0.887.
then i read the wscript file. 
i modifioed the file ndnsim/ns3/bindings/python/wscript  line 16
REQUIRED_PYBINDGEN_VERSION = '0.17.0.887' instead of
REQUIRED_PYBINDGEN_VERSION = '0.17.0.post45+ng4806e4f' 

nopw when i run with --vis...all works well :))

today i am trying to compile kite
so i downloaded the ndnSim version as suggested by kite author
it gave errors and so i downgraded ns3 to older version 3.19 (this was released right before she started her dev work)
it gives error that i am compiling one by one

i changed the files:
ns-3/src/topology-read/model/topology-reader.h
ns-3/src/point-to-point/helper/point-to-point-helper.h
ns-3/src/point-to-point/helper/point-to-point-helper.cc
ns-3/src/ndnSim/helper/ndn-global-routing-helper.cc
i have added my name with comments

also i changed the pybindgen version in wscript file

then ns-3 folder
./waf configure --enable-examples --boost-libs=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu
sudo ./waf --boost-libs=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu install

then go to kite folder
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig ./waf configure --debug --boost-libs=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu
this ouputs to a folder called build

./upload-run.sh --vis

when i simulate this i am getting the error
assert failed. cond = "false", msg="PPP Protocol number not defined!", file=../src/point-to-point/model/point-to-point-net-device.cc, line=622
terminate called without an active exception


10:27 AM 9/15/2015

to remove PPP Protocol number not defined i put patch for ccnx from following link
https://github.com/manseu/ns-3-ndnSIM-Modification/blob/master/patches/0001-point-to-point-Add-support-of-PPP-Ethernet-and-Ether.patch

in .../src/point-to-point/model/point-to-point-net-device.cc->
PointToPointNetDevice::PppToEther (uint16_t proto)
     {
     case 0x0021: return 0x0800;   //IPv4
     case 0x0057: return 0x86DD;   //IPv6
+    case 0x0077: return 0x7777;   //CCNx
     default: NS_ASSERT_MSG (false, "PPP Protocol number not defined!");
     }
PointToPointNetDevice::EtherToPpp (uint16_t proto)
     {
     case 0x0800: return 0x0021;   //IPv4
     case 0x86DD: return 0x0057;   //IPv6
+    case 0x7777: return 0x0077;   //CCNx
     default: NS_ASSERT_MSG (false, "PPP Protocol number not defined!");
     }

in .../src/point-to-point/model/ppp-header.cc
PppHeader::Print (std::ostream &os) const ...
...
     case 0x0057: /* IPv6 */
       proto = "IPv6 (0x0057)";
       break;
+    case 0x0077: /* CCNx */
+      proto = "CCNx (0x0077)";
+      break;
     default:
       NS_ASSERT_MSG (false, "PPP Protocol number not defined!");
     }
now recompile ns3 and install again
now i can run all the scenario files
./upload-run.sh --vis
./sync-run.sh --vis
./upload-sim.pl
./sync-sim.pl
although i am not able to terminate ./upload-sim.pl ..
i have to understand code now and how this is integrated in to ndnsim if at all it is
